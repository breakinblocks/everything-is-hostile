Since witchcraft is a method to harness the power of nature, placing an altar in a location with little or no living things will yield very little magic to work with. An altar is created by placing six altar blocks in a 2x3 pattern; you will know it is correct when a red cloth appears over the top of the altar. Activating the altar by right-clicking on it will bring up a screen showing how much power the altar has collected, how much it can collect and its current recharge rate. It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery or kettle recipe. The  maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar, dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well).\"",

A kettle must be set up in the correct way, before it may be used. Firstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). Next the kettle must be filled by using a Water-filled Bucket on it. Thirdly, the ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). Finally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew.It is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from thekettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated. When a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls). All recipes can be found in the book Witchcraft: Brews \u0026 Infusions, and they all require six ingredients.",
